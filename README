Several sample sites using Ruby on 10gen.

Right now the only site included is the "basic" site. This is meant as a proof
of concept of a Ruby site running on 10gen. Implementations of tutorials for
Ruby are forthcoming.

Tutorial documentation can also be reached from our main developer documentation
page, here: http://www.10gen.com/wiki/DevDocumentation
